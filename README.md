# UCSF_QBI_Hackathon_ImageSegmentor
The Image Segmentation scripts for Josh and Noel at Optical Biosystems. 

Josh had flourcent images with DAPI labeling the neuclei of neurons in mouse brain slices. 
The team used a modified watershed, Voronoi and U-NET CNN to do the segmentations. In addition to segmenting the neuclei the neuclei centers were found using centroids method.
